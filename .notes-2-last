LAST: Genome-Scale Sequence Comparison

Requirements

To handle mammalian genomes, it's best if you have at least 10-20 gigabytes of real memory, but you can get by with 2 gigabytes.

To install the software, you need a C++ compiler. On Linux, you might need to install a package called "g++". On Mac, you might need to install command-line developer tools. On Windows, you might need to install Cygwin.

Setup

Using the command line, go into the top-level LAST directory. To compile the programs, type:

>> make

You might get some harmless warning messages. If your compiler is really old, you might get an error message like this:

unrecognized command line option "-std=c++11"

In that case, you can compile like this (which will disable multi-threading):

make CXXFLAGS=-O3

Or you can specify another compiler like this:

make CXX=MyOtherCompiler

Install (optional)

You can copy the programs and scripts to a standard "bin" directory (using "sudo" to request administrator permissions):

sudo make install

Or copy them to your personal bin directory:

make install prefix=~
>> make install prefix=~/Projects/Addgene/addgene-bioinformatics/local

You might have to log out and back in before your computer recognizes the new programs.
