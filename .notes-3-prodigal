Installing on Mac OS X

You can install on Mac OS X using homebrew or follow the instructions for the Generic Unix installation. To use the generic instructions, you will need to have XCode installed, which provides access to gcc and make.

Installing on Generic Unix

>> $ git clone https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal

By "Generic Unix", we mean any system with gcc, make, and install. This includes MacOSX (BSD) and all flavors of Linux.

After you have uncompressed the source code, cd into the directory and do:

$ make install 
This will install the prodigal binary in /usr/local/bin. If you wish to put it somewhere else, you can override the INSTALLDIR variable in the makefile.

$ make install INSTALLDIR=/where/i/want/prodigal/
Alternatively, you can just do:

>> $ make
>> $ make all clean
to compile the executable in the current directory and then move it wherever you like.

>> # mv prodigal ../../bin
